* done:
- prevent SQL injections
- make user password input invisible
- function to be able to choose how many entrys
- if user enters password incorrectly user only needs to re enter password(email doesnt need to be reentered)
- limit number of logins to prevent abuse
- cooldown when user enters password incorrectly

*to do:
- batch file to run the program instantly without needing to fill in commands to run it.
- track date and time so you can maximumly register a project of a year ago(consult productowner)
- only allow the requested data otherwise reject for example when asked time only allow 00:00 otherwise reject
- Press ? to get help for commands like cntrl + c to go back
- check if emailadress is an valid emailadress													
- change colors when entering program
- name: user input instead of question: user input
- improve error handling
- function to reset password
- autoscroll
- users can edit and delete/restore deleted entries

Login Attempts Limit:

It's common to implement a login attempt limit to prevent brute force attacks. A typical threshold is around 3 to 5 failed attempts before imposing restrictions.
Keep in mind that too many restrictions may inconvenience legitimate users, so finding a balance is crucial.
Lockout Duration:

If the user exceeds the allowed login attempts, consider implementing a lockout duration before they can attempt to log in again. This prevents continuous brute force attacks.
A common lockout duration is 15 to 30 minutes, but you should adjust this based on your application's requirements.
Reset Count After Restart:

Resetting the login attempt count after the program restarts is a matter of usability and security.
Resetting the count can be more user-friendly, but it might also make it easier for attackers to continuously attempt to guess the password.
If you don't reset the count, users may be locked out for a longer time, but it adds an extra layer of security.
Account Recovery:

Implement a secure account recovery process, such as sending a password reset link to the user's email, in case they forget their password or get locked out.
Logging and Monitoring:

Log failed login attempts and regularly monitor logs to detect any suspicious activity. This helps in identifying potential security threats.
